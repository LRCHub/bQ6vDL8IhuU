We're starting it over
We're making way for destiny
A time to turnover
A better life for you and me
A new recreation
To channel all this energy
Let's solve the equation
I need to feel, you close to me
So baby let your conscience go
There's no turning back when love takes hold
Hold me baby, drive me crazy
Touch me all night long
Make me love you, kiss and hug you
Touch me all night long
The more that I see you
The more I know that love belongs
With you in my mind boy
I wouldn't know what's right from wrong
'Cause love will takeover
And leave you out of sight and mind
You've got to go with the feeling
And trust fate to be kind
And baby let your conscience go
There's no turning back when love takes hold
Hold me baby, drive me crazy
Touch me all night long
Make me love you, kiss and hug you
Touch me all night long
Hold me baby, drive me crazy
Touch me all night long
Make me love you, kiss and hug you
Touch me all night long
And baby let your conscience go
There's no turning back once love gets hold
Hold me baby, drive me crazy
Touch me all night long
Make me love you, kiss and hug you
Touch me all night long
Hold me baby, drive me crazy
Touch me all night long
Make me love you, kiss and hug you
Touch me all night long
Hold me baby, drive me crazy
Touch me all night long
