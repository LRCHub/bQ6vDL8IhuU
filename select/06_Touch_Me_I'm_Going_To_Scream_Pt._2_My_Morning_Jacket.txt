If you touch me, well I just think I'll scream
'Cause it's been so long, since someone challenged me
And made me think, about the way things are
Made me think, about the way they could be
I believe it, why? Oh my
Ooh my lord
Ooh my lord
I don't even know why, but
Oh! This feeling it is wonderful! Don't you ever turn it off!
Oh! This feeling it is wonderful! Don't you ever turn it off!
Feelings, why?
Oh my, human needs, heartbeats
I can see it all, by the way you smile
I'm smiling too! I see myself in you
I am with it! Ooh man I am wired!
Ooh my lord! Ooh my lord- yeah
Now I really know why!
Oh! This feeling it is wonderful! Don't you ever turn it off!
Oh! This feeling it is wonderful! Don't you ever turn it off!
