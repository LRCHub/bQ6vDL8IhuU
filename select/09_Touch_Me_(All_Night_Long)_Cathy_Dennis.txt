Oh, oh, oh, oh

We're starting it over, we're making way for destiny
A time to turn over, a better life for you and me (for you and me)
A new recreation to channel all this energy, mmm
It's all the equation, I need to keep you close to me

So baby, let your conscience go
There's no turning back when love takes hold

Hold me baby, drive me crazy
Touch me all night long
Make me love you, kiss and hug you
Touch me all night long

Oh, oh, oh, oh

The more that I see you
The more I know that love belongs, mmm
With you in my mind, boy
I wouldn't know what's right from wrong

'Cause love will take over
And leave you out of sight and mind (sight and mind)
You've got to go with the feeling
And trust fate to be kind

And baby, let your conscience go
There's no turning back when love takes hold

Hold me baby, drive me crazy
Touch me all night long
Make me love you, kiss and hug you
Touch me all night long

Hold me baby, drive me crazy
Touch me all night long
Make me love you, kiss and hug you
Touch me

Oh, let's do it
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let's do it

And baby, let your conscience go
There's no turning back when love takes hold

Hold me baby, drive me crazy (drive me crazy)
Touch me, all night long (ooh)
Make me love you, kiss and hug you (make me love you)
(Baby, love me) touch me all night long

Hold me baby (hold me), drive me crazy (hold me)
Touch me, all night long (all night long)
