Touch me, touch me, touch me now Touch me, touch me,
I wanna feel your body Your heartbeat next to mine Touch me,
Touch me now, touch me,
Touch me now Full moon in the city and the night was young I was
Hungry for love, I was hungry for fun I was hunting you down and I
Was the bait When I saw you there,
I didn't need to hesitate This is the night,
This is the night, this is the time We've got to get it right (
This is the night) Touch me, touch me,
I wanna feel your body Your heartbeat next to mine (
This is the night) Touch me, touch me now, touch me,
Touch me now Hot and cold emotion,
Confusing my brain I could not decide between pleasure and pain Like
A tramp in the night,
I was begging for you To treat my body like you wanted to This is the
Night, this is the night,
This is the time We've got to get it right (
This is the night) Touch me, touch me,
I wanna feel your body Your heartbeat next to mine (
This is the night) Touch me, touch me now, touch me,
Touch me now Touch me, touch me,
I wanna feel your body Your heartbeat next to mine (
This is the night) Touch me, touch me now, touch me,
Touch me now Touch me, touch me now, touch me, touch me now,
Yeah Touch me, touch me now, mm, touch me, touch me now, yeah (
This is the night) Touch me, touch me,
I wanna feel your body Your heartbeat next to mine (
This is the night) '
Cause I want your body all the time, yeah Touch me,
Touch me, I wanna feel your body Your heartbeat next to mine (
This is the night) Touch me, touch me now, touch me,
Touch me now Touch me, touch me now, mm, touch me,
