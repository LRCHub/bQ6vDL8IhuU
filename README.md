# the engy – Touch me

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
You'll find nothing in my heart.
Sorry I'm losing myself.
Over and over,
You've made a call.
But I'm not there.
I'm way up here.
And I fall into pieces.
When you're not around
I don't know where I am.
Come and find me.
If I have you here,
I want nothing at all.
And I fall into pieces.
It's so funny.
I miss you so.
But
Sorry I don't call you back.
I'm begging you.
I can't call you back.
Just find me out.
Can you touch me?
Can you touch me?
Can you touch me like I do?
You'll find nothing in my place.
I got number.
And a phone.
But I can't
Over and Over
You've made a call
Sorry I don't call you back.
Don't go away
Can you touch me like I do?
